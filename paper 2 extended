The methodology described in the document introduces DocSCAN, an unsupervised text classification approach based on the Semantic Clustering by Adopting Nearest-Neighbors (SCAN) algorithm. The approach leverages semantically informative vectors obtained from a pre-trained language model and applies a learnable clustering approach using neighboring data points as a weak learning signal to automatically learn topic assignments.

The methodology involves several key components and algorithms:

Semantic Clustering by Adopting Nearest-Neighbors (SCAN) Algorithm:
The SCAN algorithm is the foundation of the DocSCAN approach. 
It is based on the intuition that a data point and its nearest neighbors in a representation space often share the same class label. 
The algorithm consists of three stages: learning representations via a self-learning task, mining nearest neighbors, 
and fine-tuning a network on the weak signal that two neighbors share the same label.



Self-learning Task and Representation Space: The methodology utilizes a self-learning task to obtain representations of documents from a pre-trained language model.
The representations are obtained from a large pre-trained language model,
such as SBERT (Sentence-BERT), which provides semantically informative vectors for each document.


Clustering and Fine-tuning: The learnable clustering approach uses pairs of neighboring data points as a weak learning signal to automatically learn topic assignments.
This involves fine-tuning networks on neighboring data points using the SCAN loss.

Evaluation and Benchmarking: The methodology applies DocSCAN to three widely used and diverse text 
classification benchmarks: The 20NewsGroup data, the AGâ€™s news corpus, and the DBPedia ontology dataset.
The performance of DocSCAN is compared against various unsupervised baselines and a supervised learning baseline.

Ablation Experiments: The methodology includes ablation experiments to investigate the influence of different hyperparameters
and input features on the performance of DocSCAN.
This involves exploring the number of neighbors considered, the weight of the entropy loss, batch sizes, dropout, and number of epochs.

Document Embeddings: The methodology experiments with different document embeddings, 
including TF-IDF-weighted bag-of-n-grams, GloVe embeddings, 
Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) embeddings, and SBERT embeddings. The performance of DocSCAN using different input features is evaluated and compared.

Overall, the methodology combines the use of pre-trained language models, 
neighbor-based clustering, and fine-tuning techniques to develop an unsupervised text classification approach.
It leverages the strengths of deep Transformer networks and semantic representations to achieve strong performance in text classification tasks.
